# Quick Start Guide - Formal Proof Roadmap

This guide helps you navigate the formal verification documentation for the 3D Navier-Stokes formalization.

## What's New

We've added comprehensive documentation of the Lean 4 formal verification effort, including:

1. **Formal Proof Roadmap** - Complete status of all theorems and axioms
2. **Dependency Graphs** - Visual representations of module dependencies
3. **Statistics** - Quantitative analysis of the formalization progress

## For Reviewers

### Quick Overview

Start with the [Formal Proof Roadmap](FORMAL_PROOF_ROADMAP.md) which provides:
- Overall completion status (~40%)
- Module organization (18 modules in 5 layers)
- Proven theorems (18) vs axioms requiring proof (27)
- Critical path to main results

### Understanding Dependencies

View the dependency graphs:
- **Mermaid diagram**: [diagrams/lean_dependencies.mmd](diagrams/lean_dependencies.mmd) (renders on GitHub)
- **DOT format**: [diagrams/lean_dependencies.dot](diagrams/lean_dependencies.dot) (for GraphViz)
- **ASCII trees**: [diagrams/dependencies_*.txt](diagrams/) (for each main theorem)

Color coding:
- ðŸ”´ Red = Main theorems (MainTheorem, Theorem13_7, SerrinEndpoint)
- ðŸ”µ Blue = BKM closure modules
- ðŸŸ¢ Green = Riccati analysis modules
- ðŸŸ¡ Yellow = Foundation modules

### Checking Specific Modules

For detailed information about a specific module, see the [Detailed Module Analysis](FORMAL_PROOF_ROADMAP.md#detailed-module-analysis) section which includes:
- Purpose and role
- Dependencies
- Structures and definitions
- Theorems and axioms
- Status and next steps

## For Contributors

### Finding Work

1. Check the [Verification Checklist](FORMAL_PROOF_ROADMAP.md#verification-checklist)
2. Look for items marked with `[ ]` (not yet complete)
3. Review the **Priority** sections to find critical work

### Understanding Dependencies

Before proving a theorem:
1. Check its dependencies in the [Theorem Dependency Tree](FORMAL_PROOF_ROADMAP.md#theorem-dependency-tree)
2. Ensure all prerequisites are proven
3. Review the [Critical Path](FORMAL_PROOF_ROADMAP.md#critical-path-priority) to prioritize work

### Regenerating Documentation

After modifying Lean files, update the documentation:

```bash
cd /path/to/3D-Navier-Stokes

# Regenerate all graphs and statistics
python3 tools/generate_lean_dependency_graph.py --output-dir Documentation/diagrams

# The tool will generate:
# - Mermaid diagram (.mmd)
# - GraphViz DOT (.dot)
# - ASCII dependency trees (.txt)
# - Statistics (.md)
```

## For Mathematicians

### Proof Strategy

The [Formal Proof Roadmap](FORMAL_PROOF_ROADMAP.md) explains:
- How modules are organized by mathematical content
- The proof architecture from foundations to main results
- Key lemmas and their dependencies

### Critical Path

The main result `global_regularity_unconditional` follows this dependency chain:

```
BasicDefinitions â†’ UniformConstants â†’ DyadicRiccati â†’ 
ParabolicCoercivity â†’ GlobalRiccati â†’ BKMClosure â†’ Theorem13_7
```

Each arrow represents a mathematical dependency that must be proven.
