## Implementation Status

### Completed âœ…
- [x] File structure and module organization
- [x] Stub implementations for external dependencies
- [x] All theorem statements with proper types
- [x] Integration with existing NavierStokes modules
- [x] Documentation and comments

### Pending ðŸ”„
- [ ] Full proofs using Mathlib theorems (currently using `sorry` placeholders)
- [ ] Complete Sobolev theory integration from Mathlib
- [ ] Full graph Laplacian spectral theory
- [ ] Integration with actual external repositories (adelic-bsd, P-NP, etc.)

## Design Philosophy

The implementation follows a **stub-first** approach:
1. Define the API/interface that consumers need
2. Provide placeholder implementations for external dependencies
3. Create compilable theorem statements
4. Allow for incremental completion of proofs

This enables:
- Early integration testing
- API validation
- Parallel development of dependent modules
- Clear documentation of integration points

## Building

To build the Lean4 formalization (requires elan/lake):

```bash
cd Lean4-Formalization
lake update
lake build
```

## Integration Points

### With Existing Modules
- Imports from `NavierStokes.BasicDefinitions`
- Compatible with existing `VelocityField`, `PressureField` types
- Extends the NavierStokes namespace

### With External Frameworks (Stubs)
- **PNP**: Treewidth and information complexity bounds
- **QCAL**: Frequency validation at 141.7001 Hz
- Future connection to actual implementations when available

## Future Work

1. **Complete Proofs**: Replace `sorry` with actual Mathlib-based proofs
2. **External Integration**: Connect to real adelic-bsd, P-NP repositories
3. **Graph Theory**: Full implementation of spectral graph algorithms
4. **Verification**: Add computational verification alongside formal proofs
5. **Documentation**: Expand mathematical documentation for each theorem
