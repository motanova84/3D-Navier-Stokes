## Diagnostic Tools

### DiagnosticReport.lean

A Lean 4 file that provides:
- Structured statistics for each file
- Completion percentage calculations
- Formatted report generation
- Overall progress tracking

Run with:
```bash
lake build DiagnosticReport
lake env lean --run DiagnosticReport.lean
```

### diagnostic_tool.py

A Python script that automatically analyzes Lean files and generates reports.

Run with:
```bash
python3 diagnostic_tool.py
```

## Current Status

As of the latest analysis:

- **Total Files**: 6
- **Total Lemmas/Theorems**: 22
- **Pending Proofs (sorry)**: 12
- **Overall Completion**: 45%

### File-by-File Breakdown

| File | Lemmas | Sorry | Completion |
|------|--------|-------|------------|
| Basic.lean | 6 | 1 | 83% |
| LocalExistence.lean | 3 | 3 | 0% |
| EnergyEstimates.lean | 4 | 2 | 50% |
| GlobalRegularity.lean | 3 | 3 | 0% |
| CouplingTensor.lean | 3 | 2 | 33% |
| FrequencyEmergence.lean | 3 | 1 | 66% |

## Dependency Structure

```
Basic.lean (foundational)
├── LocalExistence.lean
│   ├── EnergyEstimates.lean
│   │   └── GlobalRegularity.lean
├── CouplingTensor.lean
│   └── FrequencyEmergence.lean
```

## Priority for Completion

1. **High Priority**:
   - LocalExistence.lean - Core existence theory
   - EnergyEstimates.lean - Essential for regularity

2. **Medium Priority**:
   - GlobalRegularity.lean - Main result
   - CouplingTensor.lean - Key mechanism

3. **Low Priority**:
   - Basic.lean - Nearly complete (83%)
   - FrequencyEmergence.lean - Nearly complete (66%)

## Usage

### Analyzing Files

To regenerate the diagnostic report:

```bash
# Using Python tool
python3 diagnostic_tool.py

# Using Lean (requires Lean 4 installation)
lake env lean --run DiagnosticReport.lean
```

### Adding New Files

To add a new file to the analysis:

1. Create the Lean file in the PsiNSE/ directory
2. Update `diagnostic_tool.py` to include the new file in the `files` list
3. Update `DiagnosticReport.lean` to include the new file statistics
4. Run the diagnostic tool to verify

## Contributing

When working on proofs:

1. Remove `sorry` statements by providing complete proofs
2. Ensure all dependencies are satisfied
3. Run the diagnostic tool to update completion status
4. Update documentation as needed

## Notes

- The diagnostic system uses regex pattern matching to count `sorry` statements and lemmas
- Counts include `theorem`, `lemma`, and `def` declarations
- Comments and string literals are not filtered out in the simple implementation
- For production use, consider using Lean's meta-programming facilities for more accurate analysis
