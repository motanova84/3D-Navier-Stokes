# Computational Impossibility Analysis - Artifacts

This directory contains visualization outputs from `computational_impossibility_analysis.py`, which demonstrates the fundamental computational barriers to verifying global regularity of the Navier-Stokes equations.

## Generated Visualizations

The script generates the following four visualization files:

### 1. `computational_barriers.png` (113 KB)
- **Left Panel**: Exponential growth of DNS grid point requirements (N ~ Re^(9/4))
- **Right Panel**: Simulation time requirements in years for 10 physical seconds
- Shows feasibility zones for current (Frontier 2023) and future (2050) supercomputers
- Demonstrates why Re → ∞ is computationally impossible

### 2. `numerical_error_accumulation.png` (61 KB)
- Visualization of round-off error accumulation over time steps
- Shows error growth as √n·ε_machine (random walk behavior)
- Illustrates thresholds where solutions become corrupted
- Demonstrates fundamental limitation of floating-point arithmetic

### 3. `computational_uncertainty.png` (51 KB)
- Visualization of the CFL (Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy) constraint
- Shows relationship between spatial resolution (Δx) and time step (Δt)
- Illustrates stable region under CFL condition
- Includes Planck scale limit as theoretical boundary

### 4. `computational_impossibility_summary.png` (311 KB)
- Comprehensive summary visualization with 3×3 grid layout
- Central panel: Main impossibility statement with 4 fundamental barriers
- Peripheral panels: Icons representing different computational obstacles
  - Resolution explosion
  - Time requirements
  - Memory constraints
  - Round-off errors
  - CFL condition
  - NP-hard complexity
  - Energy cascade
  - Vorticity stretching

## Usage

To regenerate these visualizations:

```bash
python3 computational_impossibility_analysis.py
```

The script will:
1. Analyze 4 fundamental computational barriers
2. Generate detailed console output with calculations
3. Save all visualization files to this `artifacts/` directory

## Note

These files are excluded from version control (see `.gitignore`) as they are generated outputs. Only the `.gitkeep` file is tracked to preserve the directory structure.
